```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown


```{r cars}
con <- sdalr::con_db("sdal", pass = sdalr::get_my_password())

db = DBI::dbGetQuery(con, 'SELECT * 
                     FROM geospatial$census_cb.cb_2016_51_bg_500k')

head(db)

head(wkb::readWKB(db$wkb_geometry))

head(sf::st_centroid(db$AFFGEOID))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
